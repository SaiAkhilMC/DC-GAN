DCGAN for Generating Synthetic Chest X-Ray Images!!!

In this project a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) was used to generate synthetic chest X-ray images. By training the DCGAN on a dataset of real chest X-rays, the model learns to produce realistic synthetic images, which can be used for various applications such as data augmentation, medical training, and research. The goal is to provide high-quality synthetic chest X-rays to support and enhance medical imaging analysis.
Variety of datasets are available in Kaggle.
